Exceptions work by first making a "try" block, and following this with 
one or more "catch" blocks. If a "throw" is executed from inside the "try" block, 
it will exit the "try" block and search for a relevant "catch" block to tell it what to do. 
In general, if there are multiple catch blocks, they will each deal with a different type of exception. 
The general format looks like this:

try {
	//code that may result in exceptions being thrown
}
catch (type of exception to be caught) { 
	//action to take when this exception is caught
}
catch (alternative type of exception to be caught) {
	//action to take when this alternative exception is caught
}

In addition to manually entered exceptions (such as the one on line 20, which throws the number 0), C++ will 
also automatically throw an exception by itself in some circumstances. For example, if memory has not been allocated properly, or 
if the user attempts to access a vector element which is out of range. These exceptions are all objects and the individual types are 
all children of the class "std::exception". A reference list of these can be found here.

When an excetion is thrown, it will usually throw with it some kind of object or variable. This will be used to decide which catch 
block to execute. For example, line 16 throws an object of class "std::invalid_argument". This means that if you create a catch that listens 
for this class of objects, it will activate when this object is thrown. For example:

catch(invalid_argument& e)  {
	// what to do in this case here	
}

Within this block, the object thrown has been assigned the label "e" and the quoted text input on line 16 can be accessed with the function
"e.what()". In this case, replacing "invalid_argument" with "exception" would also have caught this exception, as invalid_argument is a child of 
exception (see aforementioned reference list).

My actual code for this one is quite simple:

        try {
            cout << Server::compute(A,B) << endl;
        } 
        catch (bad_alloc& error) {
            cout << "Not enough memory" << endl;
        }
        catch (exception& error) {
            cout << "Exception: " << error.what() << endl;
        }
        catch (...) {
            cout << "Other Exception" << endl;
        }

This code passed all test cases. But I want to explain what I did in the context of my previous explanations of exceptions. The first 3 lines are the "try" block. 
In this block we just have the call to use the compute(A,B) function and to print the result. Since this is a static function (see line 13), we don't need to create 
any objects of type Server, we can just call it directly instead.

If there is something wrong with the inputs, then executing this function will throw out the relevant exception. As the problem states, we need to be able to handle 3 different scenarios:

1. Not enough memory allocated
2. Other standard C++ exception
3. Other non-standard C++ exception

The first catch will be triggered whenever a "bad_alloc" exception occurs. Scenario 1 is actually a standard C++ exception, but we need to give it special treatment with a 
unique message for the challenge. This is why we put this catch first and the catch for all standard C++ exceptions second, because otherwise the "bad_alloc" exception would be treated the same as the others.

The second scenario will trigger when any other exceptions in the C++ exception library occur (again, find a list of these exceptions here). Because the line 16 has manual text, this text will print whenever 
this throw occurs. All other exceptions will print some standard code that gives some clue as to what caused the exception.

The final catch uses an ellipses (...) as the catch condition. This means that this catch will be triggered by any other exceptions not caught by the previous catches. Notably, this will be caused by the throw 
on line 20, as this is throwing a zero, which is not a standard C++ exception.

Any of these catches being triggered will cause the loop to immediately move to the next iteration, so you don't have to worry about the computation being printed if they occur.
