# reduce() in Python :
# The reduce(fun,seq) function is used to apply a particular function passed in its argument to 
# all of the list elements mentioned in the sequence passed along.This function is defined in “functools” module.


# Tasks : 
# You will be given two arrays of integers and asked to determine all integers that satisfy the following two conditions:
#     1. The elements of the first array are all factors of the integer being considered
#     2. The integer being considered is a factor of all elements of the second array
# These numbers are referred to as being between the two arrays. You must determine how many such numbers exist.

    lcm_a = reduce(lambda x,y: x*y//math.gcd(x,y), a)  # Calculating the lcm for array a
    gcd_b = reduce(math.gcd, b)  # Calculating the GCD for array b
    return (sum(gcd_b%x==0 for x in range(lcm_a,gcd_b+gcd_b,lcm_a)))

# Sample Input
# 2 3
# 2 4
# 16 32 96

# Sample Output
# 3

# Explanation
# 2 and 4 divide evenly into 4, 8, 12 and 16.
# 4, 8 and 16 divide evenly into 16, 32, 96.
# 4, 8 and 16 are the only three numbers for which each element of a is a factor and each is a factor of all elements of b.
