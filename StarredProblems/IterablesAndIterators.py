# The itertools module standardizes a core set of fast, memory efficient tools that are useful by themselves 
# or in combination. Together, they form an iterator algebra making it possible to construct specialized tools 
# succinctly and efficiently in pure Python.

# You are given a list of N lowercase English letters. For a given integer K, you can select 
# any indices (assume 1-based indexing) with a uniform probability from the list.

# Find the probability that at least one of the K indices selected will contain the letter: 'a'.

# Input Format
# The input consists of three lines. The first line contains the integer N, denoting the length of the list. 
# The next line consists of N space-separated lowercase English letters, denoting the elements of the list.
# The third and the last line of input contains the integer K, denoting the number of indices to be selected.

# Output Format
# Output a single line consisting of the probability that at least one of the
# indices selected contains the letter:'a'.

# Note: The answer must be correct up to 3 decimal places. 

from itertools import combinations
N = int(input()) # Length of the list
l = list(map(str,input().split()))
K = int(input()) # It denoted the number of indices to be selected

# Find the probability that at least one of the K indices selected will contain the letter: 'a'

C = list(combinations(l, K))
simple_with_a = [i for i in C if 'a' in i]
print("%.3f" %(len(simple_with_a)/ len(C)))

# Sample Input
# 4 
# a a c d
# 2

# Sample Output
# 0.8333

# Explanation
# All possible unordered tuples of length 2 comprising of indices from a to d are:
# ('a', 'a'), ('a', 'c'), ('a', 'd'), ('a', 'c'), ('a', 'd'), ('c', 'd')   
# Out of these 6 combinations, 5 of them contain either index 1 or index 2 which are the indices that contain the letter 'a'.
# Hence, the answer is 5/6.
